      "      only on Sundays during two years—they were simply called his “other\r\n",
      "      clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The\r\n",

      "      found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following\r\n",
      "      the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten o’clock he\r\n",
      "      came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat\r\n",
      "      lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything was quiet\r\n",

      "      happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for\r\n",
      "      the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels\r\n",

      "      defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and\r\n",
